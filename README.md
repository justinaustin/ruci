# TODO
* function taking in board and move and returning a new board
after that move (update en passant, etc)
* better position evaluation
* zobrist hashing
* work on checkmate in position evaluation...right now it evaluates
to -500 or some number but then it will still calculate black taking
the king after white takes it and values the position as even...
